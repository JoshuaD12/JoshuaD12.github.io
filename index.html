<h1>Journey to heaven</h1>
<p>If you are a Christian then you would want to know the nessary steps to get to heaven. Let me first explain and define what is a christian. People for some reason think a Christian is someone who just goes to church and say that they are Christian but the truth is that a Christian is who strives to live the way Jesus Christ live his life on earth. Is does not matter how much you go to church, what matters is how hard you work to be like Christ.</p>
